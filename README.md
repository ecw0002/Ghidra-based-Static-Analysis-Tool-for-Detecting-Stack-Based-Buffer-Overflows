**Overflow Detection from Sinks and Sources<h1>**

This repository is part of a thesis to detect stack-based buffer overflows in 
C programs. 

The final product is a single script that can detect buffer overflows using 
Ghidra. The script is intended to run on Ghidra version 9.1-BETA.

To run the script, load the script into Ghidra's script manager. Then open the
binary file that you want to run the analysis on in Ghidra. Then run the script.

The archive folder consists of previous tests and prototypes of the tool.

The CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow folder contains the tests from the Juliet
test suite.

The Ghidra_files folder consists of the files that are generated by Ghidra when 
a file is load into Ghidra. (*note: The permissions are set per user, so these
are not able to opened by anyone other than the owner)

The New_Test_Set folder contains the test cases from the thesis and the results.
